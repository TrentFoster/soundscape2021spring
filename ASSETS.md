All of the sounds that I have gathered so far have come from freesounds.org and include...


1. flag sounds come from bmoreno entitled "0384 Flags.wav"
2. seagull sounds by Moulaythami entitled "Seagull, Solo A"
3. Wooden sound creaks by PimFeijen entitled "LargeWoodenShip.mp3"
4. Ocean waves sound by Noted451 entitled"Ocean Waves.wav"
5. the 'chatter' noise by Awesomeman entitled "Outdoor crowd noise"
6. the thunder/rain sound by InspectorJ entitled "Thunder, Very Close, Rain, A.wav"
7. chirping birds by lorenzgiller entitled "Singing Birds"
8. hammer sound by cmusounddesign entitled "hammer.wav"
9. crowd cheer by tim.kahn entitled "cheer 01.wav"


I also used 2 short snips of pirate shanties that I got from Ubisoft's "Assassin Creed: BlackFlag" video game 
 - I am making a claim under the fairuse rule since the sounds were not the main focus of my soundscape and I used very little of the actual hour long sound track
