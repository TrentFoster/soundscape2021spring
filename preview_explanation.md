In this short preview of mine, I layed out the not yet finished background noises of my piece.
This includes sounds that I feel are necessary to give off the feeling of being on a old wooden
ship. The four layers that I have included consists of a wooden creaking sound,
a flag flapping in the wind(I'm using as a sail flapping in the wind), the chirping of seagulls,
and lastly the sound of ocean waves in the background. I tweaked the sounds of each of these so
that one sound does not completely overrule the others, but I'm sure I'll be doing that many 
more times over the course of the project. 

Some more things that I will add in the future for background sounds include

1. the sound of a hammer pounding wood
2. background chatter
3. possibly parrot phrases or chirps
